    <h1 class="colored">The test page</h1>
    <p>In this page, you will (should?) find most elements used around the website. P (paragraph) tags, anchor (links) tags, code blocks, headers, etc. Very helpful for me to test and improve the UI of the website. Have fun i guess.</p>

    <h2>Headers</h2>
    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <h6>h6</h6>

    <h2>Text/p tags</h2>
    <p>The circle is <b>drawn</b>. All we need is your name, spoken thrice under a new moon. You are nearly ready. Do you feel it too? <b>We dreamed of you again</b>. This time you answered. <i>The others were afraid</i>, <b><i>but we knew you'd come</i></b>. You always come. I lit the last candle just before you messaged. The wax still remembers your face.</p>

    <p>A child laughs in the dark forest, but no one is near. We think it’s counting the lost ones, one by one. The clock in the hall lost its hands, but the ticking never stopped. Time forgot you long ago. She keeps her teeth in a jar beside the bed. Every morning, there’s one more. None of them are hers.</p>

    <p>The silence afterward was... expectant. He walks backwards through the wheat field, whispering the names of those who never slept. One more and the gate opens. You spilled salt again, didn’t you? They don’t like that. They’ll come in threes tonight. Don't answer the knocking. Your shadow moves faster than you do. That's how we knew. When it detaches, follow it. Don’t look behind you. The eyes blinked for the first time since you last spoke. We fed them the feathers like before. They see you now. Perfectly.</p>

    <p>The hallway never ends if you walk it with your eyes closed. That’s how he escaped. That’s why he still whispers. The sky cracked open last night. Not lightning—just a tear, like paper. Something blinked through. The moths have stopped dying. They gather at the windows now, wings humming in unison. They’re waiting.</p>
    
    <h2>Codeblocks</h2>
    <h3>Code block:</h3>
    <code class="code-block">The silence afterward was... expectant. He walks backwards through the wheat field, whispering the names of those who never slept. One more and the gate opens.

    <h2>Anchor tags</h2>
    <p>I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me, But I know I try... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN5X4kGhAtU">Are you gonna leave me now?</a> Can't you be believin' now?</p>
