    <h1 class="colored">The test page</h1>
    <p>In this page, you will (should?) find most elements used around the website. P (paragraph) tags, anchor (links) tags, code blocks, headers, etc. Very helpful for me to test and improve the UI of the website. Have fun i guess.</p>

    <h2>Headers</h2>
    <h1>h1</h1>
    <h2>h2</h2>
    <h3>h3</h3>
    <h4>h4</h4>
    <h5>h5</h5>
    <h6>h6</h6>

    <h2>Text/p tags</h2>
    <p>The circle is drawn. All we need is your name, spoken thrice under a new moon. You are nearly ready. Do you feel it too? We dreamed of you again. This time you answered. The others were afraid, but we knew you'd come. You always come. I lit the last candle just before you messaged. The wax still remembers your face.</p>
    
    <p>The silence afterward was... expectant. He walks backwards through the wheat field, whispering the names of those who never slept. One more and the gate opens. You spilled salt again, didn’t you? They don’t like that. They’ll come in threes tonight. Don't answer the knocking. Your shadow moves faster than you do. That's how we knew. When it detaches, follow it. Don’t look behind you. The eyes blinked for the first time since you last spoke. We fed them the feathers like before. They see you now. Perfectly.</p>
