# I created my own URL shortener: shl
This time, i decided to go the DIY way. I searched a lot for a good and minimal URL shortener to self host, but i could not find anything. So... i did it myself. Simple, minimal, and easy to use. Check it out by clicking [here](https://shl.dev64.xyz/r/shl) (thats a link shortened with shl that redirects to shl. lol).
