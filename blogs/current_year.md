# "current_year" in the index page is not a bug!
It's NOT a bug. That's how it's meant to be displayed! Many people who have seen my website have told me "yo look at this lol 'current_year' you messed up man". No. I did not.

## So what is it then?
It's an "easter egg" (I'm just throwing random words lol, not sure If it can be considered one). In python, that's a fstring (format string), and current_year is a variable which contains the current year. You're basically meant to calculate it yourself. So, current_year being... The current year, minus 2005, gives you my age. Simple, yet many people didn't seem to understand or get it...
