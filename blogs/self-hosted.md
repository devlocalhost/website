# Services i have self hosted
Note: this blog post was called "File hosting and uploading".

## Services
Currently, there are 3 services: [h5ai](https://github.com/lrsjng/h5ai), [single_php_filehost](https://github.com/Rouji/single_php_filehost) and [mkr/bin](https://github.com/MKRhere/bin). h5ai is available at [f.dev64.xyz](https://f.dev64.xyz), single_php_filehost at [u.dev64.xyz](https://u.dev64.xyz), and mkr/bin at [b.dev64.xyz](https://b.dev64.xyz). They are running separately by the way, not a part of this website.

~~I will also definitely add a url shortener soon. I am just trying to find a good one.~~ Please read [shl](/blog/shl) blog for more details.

## Why not DIY
I was thinking of going the DIY route, like i always had, but this time i followed a different route, and i like it to be honest. I would probably go the DIY route, IF i had enough time.
