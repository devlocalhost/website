# My projects
I have made a lost of projects since 2021 (?), but only a few (and the best, I'd say) are available to the public. Below you will find a list of those.

## List
- [sysmon](https://github.com/devlocalhost/sysmon/): a SYStem MONitor for Linux, made in python.
- [laurel_updates](https://laurel-updates.dev64.xyz/): a website for custom ROMs, kernels, and more for my xiaomi device.
- [trackard](https://trackard.dev64.xyz/): a apple music-like card (image) generator.
- [pyspodl](https://github.com/devlocalhost/pyspodl): a legit spotify downloader.
- [pylyrical_api](https://pylyrical.dev64.xyz/): a [genius.com](https://genius.com) scraper.
