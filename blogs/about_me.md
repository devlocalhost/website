# About Me
Hello there, I'm dev64. A (2005 - {current_year}) programmer, Linux user, Applications and Networks Technician student. I was born in Greece, Thessaloniki, and I also live there. I finished Vocational High School, and now I am doing an internship. I have no future plans yet, but I plan to get into Android app development.

## Skills
1. Python
    - Started in 2021-2022, got "serious" in 2023, where I started making advanced projects, like [sysmon](https://github.com/devlocalhost/sysmon/) and [pyspodl](https://github.com/devlocalhost/pyspodl).
    - I usually do small CLI scripts, scraping, websites in flask and others.
2. HTML & CSS
    - I can only make basic, "blog-looking" websites like this one. I prefer making simple, not complicated, and "bloat-free" websites. I prefer avoiding JavaScript because I have almost zero knowledge on it (no interests in learning it), and I also dislike it. JS frameworks included too.
    - I like to have full control over the HTML, CSS, and JS of the page, which is why i use just plain HTML, CSS and (if needed) JS. Installing and using frameworks requires a ton of other tools to install, which could make a project hard to manage, as it grows, in the future.
3. Linux
    - Started with Ubuntu in 2021-2022, with a HP Pavilion dv4000. I have used various distros, like Debian, Void, Arch, Gentoo, openSUSE, and more. Currently using Arch Linux, and a Dell Inspiron 7630 Plus.
    - Not a pro, but not a noob either. I know how to use, manage, configure, and install linux.

## Hobbies
1. Programming
    - Started in 2021-2022. Accurate date is unknown.
    - While I plan to become a programmer/developer, programming is also my hobby (If that makes sense). I love programming, and I'm very passionate about it. No plans for now, but Android app development might be my target.
2. Music
    - I listen to music daily. You can check what I listen to by visiting my [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/dev64) or [Listenbrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/user/dev64/) profiles. Alternatively, you can see my [Apple Music](https://shl.dev64.xyz/r/playm) or [Qobuz](https://shl.dev64.xyz/r/playq) playlists.
    - I'd say I listen to anything, but my main genre is Old-school hip-hop (Gang Starr, Nas, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, etc). Recently, I started listening to metal and rock.
3. Gaming
    - I haven't played a lot of games, but I've played some popular titles, like Minecraft, GTA series, Silent Hill 2 (Remake), and more.
    - On mobile, I used to play shooter/FPS games, like CODM and Bloodstrike, but due to limited time and in-game updates, I don't play that often anymore.
