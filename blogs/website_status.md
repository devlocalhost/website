# The status of this website
The website for now is kind of very empty (and useless, i guess). I am actually "rewriting" it, because before it was terrible. So, it might take some time for the website to not look "empty".

## The future
I have "big plans" for the website, let's say. I am thinking of using one of my projects, [pylyrical_api](https://pylyrical.dev64.xyz/) here, adding more API endpoints, a url shortener, and a pastebin-like service. And probably more? I don't know...
