# The status of this website
The website for now is kind of very empty (and useless, i guess). I am actually "rewriting" it, because before it was terrible. So, it might take some time for the website to not look "empty".

## The future
I have "big plans" for the website, let's say. I am thinking of using one of my projects, [pylyrical_api](https://pylyrical.dev64.xyz/) here, adding more API endpoints, a url shortener, and a pastebin-like service. And probably more? I don't know...

## Screw that (above) ?
Um, this website actually seems to be... useless...? Like, go ahead and check [Services i have self hosted](/blog/self-hosted). Those services arent a part of this website, they are hosted separately. So this website is basically a blog site. Its "full" of blog posts lol. You will only find useless/random blog posts. The index page is even worse, shit has a ton of links which look confusing i would say, i dont know.

Maybe it is fine like that, it is simple, no distractions, etc. Maybe i will keep it like that. But the index page definitely needs to be changed.
